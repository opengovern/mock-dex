# .env.compose
# Environment variables for running the application stack via Docker Compose.
# This file should typically be added to .gitignore.

# --- Server Configuration ---
# Internal port the Node.js 'app' container listens on. Nginx will proxy to this port.
PORT=3000

# --- OIDC Configuration ---
# Issuer URL of the Dex instance AS SEEN BY THE OUTSIDE WORLD or components needing validation.
# Based on your discovery doc showing 'http://localhost/dex', assuming Nginx proxies /dex correctly.
# This MUST exactly match the 'issuer' claim in ID tokens issued by Dex.
DEX_ISSUER=http://dex:5556
DEX_PUBLIC_ISSUER=http://localhost/dex
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost/app
CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost/app/auth/callback

# Client credentials for the 'app' service (must match staticClients entry in dex/config.yaml)
CLIENT_ID=clearcompass-app
CLIENT_SECRET=clearcompass-secret # Ensure this matches dex/config.yaml

# Base URL where the 'app' service is accessible BY THE USER'S BROWSER via the Nginx proxy.
# This is critical for constructing the OIDC redirect URI. Since Nginx is on host port 80.


# --- Session Configuration ---
# Use a strong, unique secret for the Docker Compose environment.
# Replace this example with a securely generated random string (e.g., openssl rand -hex 32)
SESSION_SECRET=compose-very-strong-random-secret-7f3b9a2d1e8c4a0b

# Session duration in milliseconds (e.g., 3600000 = 1 hour)
SESSION_MAX_AGE_MS=3600000

# --- Node Environment ---
# Set to 'production' for optimized performance and security settings in Node/Express.
NODE_ENV=production

# --- Notes ---
# Remember that the REDIRECT_URI constructed by app.mjs will be APP_BASE_URL + '/auth/callback'
# (i.e., 'http://localhost/auth/callback' based on the above).
# This exact URI MUST be listed in the 'redirectURIs' for 'clearcompass-app' in Dex's config.yaml.
